# w101-spell-log-script
Simple script that gets what spells creatures cast in Wizard101 based on the WizardClient.log file.

Simply download the script and run it, and if Wizard101 is open, it will automatically detect the log file and will show live when a spell is cast.

This script requires the psutil library, which you can get by running `pip install psutil`
